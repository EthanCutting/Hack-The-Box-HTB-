# Task 1 - According to MITRE ATT&CK, what previously known malware does DRATzarus share similarities with?
According to MITRE ATT&CK, the
DRATzarus remote access tool (RAT) shares similarities with Bankshot. 
Key Details
    - Malware Connection: Both DRATzarus and Bankshot are attributed to the Lazarus Group.
    - Operational Context: While DRATzarus has been used to target defense and aerospace organisations globally since approximately 2020, Bankshot was notably used in 2017 to target the Turkish financial sector.
    - Development: DRATzarus is one of several custom tools developed for Operation Dream Job, alongside others like Sumarta, DBLL Dropper, and Torisma.
    - Technical Traits: DRATzarus features capabilities such as debugger evasion using IsDebuggerPresent, system time discovery, and the ability to remotely shut down into a sleep mode to evade detection.

# Which Windows API function does DRATzarus use to detect the presence of a debugger?
According to MITRE ATT&CK, DRATzarus uses the IsDebuggerPresent Windows API function to detect the presence of a debugger on a victim's system. 
This function is part of the malware's Debugger Evasion (T1622) technique, allowing it to determine if it is being analysed in a user-mode debugger. By calling this API, the malware can modify its behavior or terminate its own process to avoid detection and reverse engineering. 
In addition to IsDebuggerPresent, DRATzarus also utilizes other system-related API calls for environmental discovery and evasion: 
    - GetTickCount and GetSystemTimeAsFileTime: Used for system time discovery and time-based evasion checks.
    - IsProcessorFeaturePresent: Sometimes used alongside other native APIs to determine if the malware is running in a sandbox environment
