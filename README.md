# Hack-The-Box-HTB

This repository contains my hands-on security work, scripts, and notes developed while completing **Hack The Box (HTB)** machines, **Sherlock (Blue Team)** investigations, and custom **automation / penetration testing scripts**.

The focus of this repo is **practical, real-world security skills**, including blue-team analysis, detection engineering, and offensive security tooling.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 🔍 `Sherlock/`
Blue Team investigation work for **HTB Sherlock challenges**.
- Log analysis
- Email forensics
- IOC extraction
- Timeline reconstruction
- Threat actor behaviour analysis
- Notes and scripts used during investigations

These scripts are designed to assist with **SOC-style triage and analysis**, not just challenge completion.

---

### ⚙️ `Scripts/`
Custom security scripts written in **Python and Bash**, focused on:
- Security automation
- Blue team tooling (email triage, log parsing, IOC extraction)
- Detection helpers
- Penetration testing support scripts
- Workflow optimisation for labs and investigations

Scripts here are built with a **defender mindset**, even when used in offensive contexts.

---

### 🖥️ `Machines/`
Notes, commands, and methodology used while working through **HTB Machines**.
- Enumeration steps
- Exploitation paths
- Privilege escalation techniques
- Post-exploitation observations

---

### 🔐 `SSH/`
SSH-related notes, configurations, and experiments used during labs and testing.

---

### 🧪 `Challenges/`
Write-ups, scripts, and notes for various HTB challenges outside of full machines.
