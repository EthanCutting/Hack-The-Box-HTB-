## PhishNet - Very Easy
An accounting team receives an urgent payment request from a known vendor. The email appears legitimate but contains a suspicious link and a .zip attachment hiding malware. Your task is to analyze the email headers, and uncover the attacker's scheme.

# 🧠 What PhishNet is actually testing
You’re NOT meant to:
  - Detonate malware
  - Reverse binaries
  - Do Windows internals
You ARE meant to:
  - Read email headers properly
  - Identify spoofing
  - Trace sender infrastructure
  - Extract URLs & attachments safely


# Task 1 - What is the originating IP address of the sender?

# Task 2 - Which mail server relayed this email before reaching the victim?

# Task 3 - What is the sender's email address?

# Task 4 - What is the 'Reply-To' email address specified in the email?


# Task 5 - What is the SPF (Sender Policy Framework) result for this email?


# Task 6 - What is the domain used in the phishing URL inside the email?


# Task 7 - What is the fake company name used in the email?


# Task 8 - What is the name of the attachment included in the email?


# Task 9 - What is the SHA-256 hash of the attachment?


# Task 10 - What is the filename of the malicious file contained within the ZIP attachment?


# Task 11 - Which MITRE ATT&CK techniques are associated with this attack?
